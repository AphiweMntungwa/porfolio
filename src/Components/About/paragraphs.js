 const parag = `Ideally this can be done by separating 'Learning how to Learn' as a 
 module or subject of it's own because no one can ever teach you everything,
 which is why 'learning how to learn' makes sense because then you can utilize
 any information.

 This matters because it gives an objective aim to both student and teacher
 as to how exactly their system works and where they fit within that system; 
 like a new tech framework, but for education.`;
