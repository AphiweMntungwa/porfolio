 const parag = `My big goal is to write a new system of learning that can
 enable the general population of our country through public schooling
 to become proficient in skills in radically shorter amount of times to
 save resources. This would seek to create a deliberate framework
 to organize schooling and then make sure that framework is taught to all
 students such that they can utilize the framework and can always be aware
 of what they're doing and why it matters.
 
 Ideally this can be done by separating 'Learning how to Learn' as a 
 module or subject of it's own because no one can ever teach you everything,
 which is why 'learning how to learn' makes sense because then you can utilize
 any information.

 This matters because it gives an objective aim to both student and teacher
 as to how exactly their system works and where they fit within that system; 
 like a new tech framework, but for education.`;
